This bundle is a reference bundle created by building a tag or branch from
source.

Because it is not a release bundle with .lpkg files, you can deploy changes
from portal-impl or portal-kernel, or changes to a small number of modules,
without having to use marketplace overrides and without running 'ant all'.

However, also because it is not a release bundle with .lpkg files, you
cannot apply fix packs or hotfixes to this bundle using patching tool.

If you are evaluating a customer hotfix, please use a release bundle or use
the 'bundle' command from the liferay-faster-deploy repository.
